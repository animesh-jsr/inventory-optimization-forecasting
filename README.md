Inventory Optimization & Demand Forecasting
Python • Time-Series Forecasting • Linear Programming • OR-Tools

This project performs end-to-end supply chain optimization, combining demand forecasting and inventory planning using:

📈 Exponential Smoothing (Holt’s method) for time-series forecasting

📊 Linear Programming (OR-Tools) for optimal order quantity planning

📂 Automated CSV & plot outputs

🏭 Realistic FMCG-style inventory workflow

It is ideal for companies dealing with production planning, procurement, and supply chain forecasting (ITC, Nestlé, Britannia, Unilever, etc.).

🚀 Features
🔮 1. Demand Forecasting

📦 2. Inventory Optimization

LP-based optimization using Google OR-Tools

Minimizes total cost (holding + stockout)

Determines optimal order quantities for each period

🗂 3. Automated Outputs

Outputs stored automatically in the results/ folder:
